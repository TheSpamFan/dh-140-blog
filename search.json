    "text": "Project Overview\n      In the genres of hip-hop and rap, Eminem is a rapper whose clever and technical delivery of provocative lyrics has made him famous among the general public and respected among his peers. While his crass and controversial word plays are notorious, Eminem also stands out as an artist whose lyrics offer a raw and unfiltered reflection of his personal experiences. My project explores both aspects by performing sentiment analysis on Eminem’s discography within his albums and exploring patterns within his works, as well as investigating possible correlations between these sentiment scores and significant events in his personal life.\n      The primary focus of this project is to analyze the sentiment of Eminem’s lyrics to uncover trends and patterns which may reflect significant elements in his personal journey. Specifically, two areas of focus will be explored:\n1. Are there any noticeable patterns in the sentiment scores within Eminem’s albums? 2. What are the observable trends in sentiment scores across Eminem’s albums, and in what ways do these trends correlate with events in his personal life?\nThe release of Eminem’s newest album, The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce) catalyzed my interest in this topic. I have never been a huge Eminem fan, although I was aware of his hit tracks such as “Without Me” and “My Name Is.” When I listened to his song “Temporary”, which is a musical letter to his daughter when he is dead, I was introduced to the emotional intensity and autobiographical aspects of his work. By analyzing sentiment trends and investigating possible correlations between these sentiments, I hope to present nuances into how Eminem’s journey has shaped his music."
